This is my attempt at createing a Jekyll site.
==============================================

It with be a profolio with an option for a blog.
------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't expect anything fancy nor produced quickly. It is a full-faith attempt at learning Jekyll. So far so good. We shall see though.

### What said site will include:

- A main hero-esque page that includes:
  - A tagline
  - A photo or two
  - A few featured videos from Vimeo
- An about page
- A contact page
- A blog page (whether I use it or not is another issue)

### Warning!

If [Dylan Turner(https://github.com/dylntrnr) ever steals any of this, he can expect the wrath of Kahn, god, and the US Justice System upon him.
